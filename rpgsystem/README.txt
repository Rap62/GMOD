Here are the commands for skill unlocks


spend ammo10
spend ammo20
spend ammo30

spend haste10
spend haste20
spend haste30

spend damage10
spend damage20
spend damage30

spend force10
spend force20
spend force30

spend melee10
spend melee20
spend melee30

if you type in just spend it will explain usage. To test give haste, the numbers are wonky so only going to change the values really.
I also commented out the booleans for the aility locks so you can stack them.

As per our discussion, instead of a hud all the info for the skills is printed via the hud. Also, the following are the changes to deliverables as discussed.

1. Level system - tracks skill points/experience points
2. Instead of a HUD/menu -> skill tree information is printed out to the console and console commands are taken for unlocks.
3. I did 15 skill/stat augmentations instead of 14 (because them it would be uneven with the whole 10/20/30 thing.)
4. For the five items, I just modded some def files. Changed how much health is given on pick up etc. If more details needed please contact.
